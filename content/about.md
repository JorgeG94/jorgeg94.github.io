# Hello there

My name is Jorge and I am a weird hybrid mixture of computational chemist and research software engineer with 
experience in High Performance Computing (HPC), specially on using GPUs to solve cool, challenging problems. 

I have experience using Python, Julia, C, C++, CUDA, HIP, and Fortran for developing scientific applications. 
Lately, I have had enough in my life of C/C++ and I am currently favouring Fortran a bit more than what I 
did during my postdoctoral appointment. 

I am currently an HPC specialist at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra, Australia 
where I am helping codebases in the geophysics, climate, and weather domain to modernise and optimise their 
code to use modern HPC architectures, like GPUs. 

## Current work projects

- Porting of [ANUGA](https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core) to GPUs 
- Porting of [MOM6](https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM6) to GPUs 

## Current personal projects 

- Development of [PIC](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic) a library for common Fortran functionality for HPC programs 
- Development of [PIC-SWE](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-swe) a shallow water equation solver using PIC as a backend
- Development of [PIC-MBE](https://github.com/JorgeG94/pic-mbe) a many body expansion driver written in Fortran
