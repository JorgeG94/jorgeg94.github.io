      <description>In my short 9 years of being a scientist/programmer I have learned a lot. I feel that the journey of scientific programming into High Performance Computing (HPC) is a common one. In my current job, my collaborators that are contributing to a weather model none of them are climate scientists nor computer scientists by education.&#xA;We are a range of physicists, mathematicians, engineers, chemists, etc. who have learned how to code in the academic fashion: &amp;ldquo;You need to write this code to write a paper so that it can get published so that you can then graduate.</description>

      <description>Hi there My name is Jorge and I am a weird hybrid mixture of computational chemist and research software engineer with experience in High Performance Computing (HPC), specially on using GPUs to solve cool, challenging problems.&#xA;I have experience using Python, Julia, C, C++, CUDA, HIP, and Fortran for developing scientific applications. Lately, I have had enough in my life of C/C++ and I am currently favouring Fortran a bit more than what I did during my postdoctoral appointment.</description>
