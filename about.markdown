## About Jorge

I was born in Tampico, Tamaulipas a small city in Mexico right on the Gulf Coast. I attended the Universidad de las Americas 
Puebla for my undergraduate degree where I obtained a Bachelors degree in Chemistry. I managed to graduate with a _magna cum laude_. After completing
my undergraduate education I went on to start a PhD program at Iowa State University under the guidance of professor Mark S. Gordon. I am
currently in my 5th year and expect to graduate in Summer 2022. 


You can see my CV [here]({% link documents/new_CV.pdf %}), alternatively a small, condensed version of it is found here.
